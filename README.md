# Online Voting System

Online Voting System is a Spring Boot-based application that allows users to cast their votes online for various elections and surveys. The application is designed to be easy to use, secure, and customizable to fit the needs of various organizations.

## Key Features

- RESTful API for voting and surveying
- Role-based access control for administrators and users
- API level permission for restricted access to certain functions
- Detailed logs for auditing and error tracking

The RESTful API for voting and surveying is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to quickly cast their votes or respond to surveys. The application also supports role-based access control, allowing administrators to define different roles with different permissions for users. This ensures that only authorized personnel can manage and access sensitive data.

API level permission provides an additional layer of security by allowing administrators to define which APIs a user can access based on their role. This ensures that only authorized users can access specific APIs and functions, enhancing the overall security of the application.

Detailed logs are also maintained for auditing and error tracking, allowing administrators to track user activity and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
